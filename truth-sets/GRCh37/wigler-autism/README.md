This dataset is the set of de novos in autism spectrum disorder from [Iossifov et al, 2014](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v515/n7526/full/nature13908.html).
Wigler's pathogenic de novos from this set are not necessarily pathogenic absolutely, but are of strong genotype quality, present only in the proband, or experimentally validated in some way.
The benigns are everything else.
