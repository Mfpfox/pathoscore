CADD (Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion) is a support vector machine model that uses machine learning to incorporate 949 features from 63 distinct annotations, including other metrics to create a prediction of variant deleteriousness.

In addition to the scores precomputed and provided by the CADD website, we have also computed CADD scores for all ClinVar benchmark set variants and Samocha set variants.
