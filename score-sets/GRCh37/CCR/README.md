CCR (Constrained Coding Regions) is from Havrilla et al., and paper can be found here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/11/16/220814.

This model uses the power of gnomAD to discover areas of the human exome under potentially purifiying selection.  It ranks regions lacking variation across 123,136 exomes in gnomAD using a linear regression of coverage-weighted length against the CpG content of those regions.
