ALoFT (annotation of loss-of-function transcripts), is a method to annotate and predict the disease-causing potential of loss-of-function variants. Using data from Mendelian disease-gene discovery projects, ALoFT can distinguish between loss-of-function variants that are deleterious as heterozygotes and those causing disease only in the homozygous state.
