A constraint score based on missense variation, from Samocha et al., Nature Genetics 2014.  The score is derived by calculating a null expectation of missense variation for each gene, and comparing it to what is observed in ExAC, then stratifying each gene using a Z score distribution.  That paper is at: https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3050

Paper it was downloaded from is the ExAC paper as the original paper doesn't have all genes.  ExAC paper at: www.nature.com/articles/nature19057
