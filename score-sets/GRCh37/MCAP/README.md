M-CAP, or the Mendelian Clinically Applicable Pathogenicity score, claims to correctly dismiss 60% of rare, missense variants of uncertain significance in a typical genome at 95% sensitivity.  The score is a supervised machine-learning based clinical pathogenicity classifier that is composed of a few components.  It contains nine pathogenicity likelihood scores: SIFT, PolyPhen-2, CADD, MutationTaster, MutationAssessor, FATHMM, LRT, MetaLR, and MetaSVM.  It also incorporates seven established measures of base-pair, amino acid, genomic region, and gene conservation: RVIS, PhyloP, PhastCons, PAM250, BLOSUM62, SIPHY, and GERP.  Additionally, it introduces 298 new features derived from multiple-sequence alignment of 99 primate, mammalian, and vertebrate genomes to the human genome.
