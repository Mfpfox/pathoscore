This is a set of genes from a recent paper on EIEE (Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy) a severe, fatal epileptic syndrome that occurs within the first few months of life.  The gene set is a compilation of gene sets from a few different companies' gene panels, as well as one from the U of Chicago.
