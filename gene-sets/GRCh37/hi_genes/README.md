The "hi\_gene" haploinsufficient gene set comes from Dang et al. (2008): https://www.nature.com/articles/ejhg2008111.  They used text-searching and database-mining on Pubmed and OMIM to extract an annotated list of human haploinsufficient genes, their associated diseases, and functions.  In total there are 299 genes.

The "clingen\_hi\_gene" haploinsufficient gene set comes from ClinGen's Dosage Sensitivity Map and is curated by Daniel MacArthur's lab.  The genes used are those that are haplosensitive and not triplosensitive, and are level 3 (the maximum level) dosage sensitive.  Original work on this is part of the Cytogenomic Arrays Consortium.
