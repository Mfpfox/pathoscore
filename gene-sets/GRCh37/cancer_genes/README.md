Manually curated list of cancer genes from Futreal et al.: https://www.nature.com/articles/nrc1299

Used the supplemental PDF table here: https://media.nature.com/original/nature-assets/nrc/journal/v4/n3/extref/nrc1299-S1.pdf

All genes were manually written into a TSV table, and many gene names were translated by hand into the correct HGNC nomenclature (e.g., IGKÎ±).

IG genes may not appear as "protein_coding" CDS in Ensembl: https://www.gencodegenes.org/gencode_biotypes.html
